Loading existing reports 100 XP

Let's get you started! We provide you with your very own
virtual machine running Power BI. It may take a few
minutes to load, but it only needs to be set up once.

Before you start loading data and creating visualizations,
it's important you know how to load existing reports. If at
any point in the course you lose progress or get stuck, you
can load the corresponding report to re-initialize. In this
exercise, well take a look at a report you will be able to
create by the end of this chapter.

All the reports used in this course are also available for
download at the bottom right of the course page if you
want to open them locally.
